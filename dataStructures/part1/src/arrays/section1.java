/* an ADT is abstract and says nothing about the concrete implementation on the
 * other hand, the data structure IS the concrete implementation / algorithm
 *
 * IE:
 * ADT 			| 		Data Structure
 * stack 		| 		array, linked list
 * priority queue 	| 		heap
 * dict / hashmap 	| 		array
 *
 * for abstract data types, we may know what the methods should do push(),
 * pop(), peek() for ds, we want to be able to do things as close to O(1) as
 * possible
